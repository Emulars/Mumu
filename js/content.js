// This file contains the encrypted story data.
// Use the setup.html tool to generate this string with your own content and password.

// Default password for this example is: "love"
// This is a placeholder. You should replace it with your own generated string.
const encryptedStory = "U2FsdGVkX1+q+X8jK9lqjZz6q+X8jK9lqjZz6q+X8jK9lqjZz6"; // This is just junk data for now.

// To make the example work immediately for the user without them running the setup tool first,
// I will include the raw data here and the script will check if 'encryptedStory' is valid.
// If not, it might fallback to this raw data for demonstration purposes (only if password is 'demo').
// BUT, for the final product, we want real security.

// So, I will provide the setup.html and ask the user to run it.
